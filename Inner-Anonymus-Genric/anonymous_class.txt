- Anonymous classes in Java are more accurately known as anonymous inner classes
- There's no such thing as anonymous classes without the "inner"
- They are defined inside another class

Note: Anonymous is always inner class
- An Anonymous (inner) class is an inner class that is delared without using a class name
- An Anonymous class must have parent class
- Reference variable of parent class can refer child class also
- we have to override the method from parent class so that we can access it
- In override, java do late binding not early binding
