Interface definition begins with keyword interface

interface just specify the method declaration(implicitly public abstract ) and can only
contains fields/variable (which are implicitly public static final)

All methods and variable is public inside interface

An interface like that of an abstarct class can not be instantiated

Interface do not have constructors

If a class that implements an interface does not define all the methods of the interface,
then it must be declared abstarct and the method definitions should be provided by the 
subclass that extends the abstract class


Multiple extension is allowed when extending interfaces i.e. one interface can extend none,
one or more interfaces

Object Refrence:
---------------
we can not create object of any interface but creation of object reference is possible

object reference of interface can refer to any its subclass type
