Its a way of we organize files into different directories according to their functionality,
	useablity as well as category they should belong to

Files in one directory(or package) would have different functionality from those of another 
	directory


eg: java.io

	files in java.io package do something related to I/O, but files in java.net package give us
			the way to deal with the Network

Name Collision
	Packaging also help us to avoid class name collision when we use the same class name as that  
		of others.

	The benefits of using packages reflects the ease of maintenance, organization and 
		collaboration among the developers.
