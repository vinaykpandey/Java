c++ => new and delete keyword 

----
Java Garbage Collection
-----------------------
	- Destruction of object from memory is done automatically by the JVM
	- No delete keyword in java
	- When there is no reference to an object, then that object is assumed to be no longer needed
		and the memory occupied by the object are released
	- This technique is called Garbage Collection
	- This is accomplished by the JVM

JVM Thread
-------------
	- Whenever we run a java program, JVM creates three threads
		- main thread
		- Thread Scheduler
		- Garbage Collector Thread

	- In these three threads, main thread is a user thread and remaining tow are daemon threads
		which run in background

	- The task of main thread is to execute the main() method
	- The task of thread scheduler is to schedule the threads
	- The task of garbage collector thread is to sweep out abandoned objects from the heap
		memory

	- Abandoned objects or dead objects are those objects which does not have live references

	-----
	finalize method
	---------------
	-  Garbage collector thread before sweeping out an Abandoned object, it calls finalize()
		method of that object
	- After finalize() method is executed, object is destroyed from the memory

------------
cannot force for gc (type of request)
------------------
	- We can call garbage collector explicitly using System.gc() or RunTime.getRunTime().gc()
	- But, it is just a request to garbage collector not a command
	- Its upto garbage collector to honor this request

--
Advantage
---------------
	Increase memory efficiency and decreases the chances for memory leak


------------
finalize()
-----------------

Object's Memory
-----------------
	- An object is created in the memory using new operator. Constructor is used to initialize 
		the properties of that object
	- When an object is no more required, it must be removed from the memory so that, that memory
		can be reused for other object
