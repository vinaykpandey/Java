class SubClass extends SuperClass{}

extends is keyword 

Base Class =>  Super Class, Parent Class
Derived Class =>  Sub Class, Child Class


In the Java, each class is allowed to have one direct superclass, and each superclass has the 
	potential for an unlimited number of subclasses.

Private members of the superclass are not accessible by the subclass and can only be indirectly 
    accessed.

Methods that have default accessibility in the superclass are also not accessible by superclasses 
	in the other packages
	

Java Supports:
	Single Inheritance    => A <- B
	Multilevel Inheritance => A <- B <- C
	Hierarchial Inheritance =>  A <- B  , A <- C
