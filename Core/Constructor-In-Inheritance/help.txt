constructor are not inherited by subclass

when we create an  object of child class, constrcutor for child class created, 
constrcutor of child class called the parent constructor

Sub class's constuctor invokes constructor of super class

Explicit call to the super class constructor from sub class's constructor can be made using super().

you can write a subclass constructor that invokes the constructor of the superclass, either implicitly or by using the keyword super
