--------
Super keyword
--------
In inheritance, subclass object when call an instance member function of subclass only,
function contains implicit reference variables this and super both reffering to the current object(Object of subclass)

The only difference this vs super :
	this:  reference variable is of subclass type
	super:  reference variable is of superclass type


	

If your method overrides one of its superclass's methods you can invoke the 
	overriden method(superclass version of the method)
	through the use of the keyword super

It avoids name conflicts between member variables of superclass and subclass
