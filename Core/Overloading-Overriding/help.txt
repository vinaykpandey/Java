Overloading
----------------

If 2 methods of a class (whether both declared in the same class, or both inherited by class,
	or one declared, one inherited) have the same name but signatures are different, then the
	method name is said to be overloaded.

Method overloading is a way to implement polymophism


Overriding
------------------
Method overriding is defining a method in subclass with the same signature with specific 
	implementation in respect to the subclass
