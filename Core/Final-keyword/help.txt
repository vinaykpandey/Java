final instance variable
-----------------------
A java variable can be declared using the keyword final. Then the final variable can be assigned 	only once.

A variable that is decalred as final and not initialized is called as a blank final variable.
	A blank final variable forces either the constructors to initialize it or initialization 
	block to this job.

-------------------
final static variable
--------------------
static member variable when qualified with final keyword, it becomes blank until initialzed

final static variable can be initialized during declaration or within the static block

--------------------
final local variable

local variables that are final must be intialized before its use,  but we remember, this rule is 
	applicable to non final local variables too.

once they are initialized, can not be altered
