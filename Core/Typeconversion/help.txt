Every expression written in the java has a type that can be reduced from the 
structure of the expression and the types of literals, variables, and the methods mentioned
in the expression


Widening Conversion
int y = 3;
float x =y; // widening conversion int -> float  (works fine)

int y = (int)x; // works fine


float x = 3.4f
int y = x; // narrowing converiosn (error)

# Note:  downgrading is error

Possible converions

byte -> short -> int -> long  ->  float -> double
short -> int -> long  ->  float -> double
char ->  int -> long  ->  float -> double
int -> long  ->  float -> double
long  ->  float -> double
