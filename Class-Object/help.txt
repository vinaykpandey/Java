Why Class ?

We need to store set of information in a data type


Primitive data type


Non-primitive data type




class is a description of an object's property and behaviour

Creating class is as good as creating data type

Class is defining a category of data


Object:

Object is a real world entity
Object is an instance of a Class
Object consumes memory to hold property values
